# React Weather App

This app fetches the current weather data for one city from [OpenWeather](https://openweathermap.org).


useState and useEffects are React Hooks that enable state management and side effect handling within functional components. useState declares a state variable that you can update directly. useEffect connects a component to an external system.

React components use props to communicate with each other. Every parent component can pass some information to its child components by giving them props. They are similar to function arguments in JavaScript and attributes in HTML.
